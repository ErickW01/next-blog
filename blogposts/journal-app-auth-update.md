Hey guys! Just a little update! Authentication went rather well and was a fun experience. Initially, I started off with NextAuth but after some trial and tribulation, I decided to look into other alternatives. Luckily, I came across better-auth - [check it out, you like like it!](https://www.better-auth.com/).

Overall, I found the documentation incredibly straightforward and well-written.

Personally, there are few things in this world better than clean documentation.

Definitely going to dive deeper into a couple auth. libraries to better understand their strengths. Cant wait :)

P.S. I'm considering of creating a newsletter that'll update any interested followers in this journey of mine! Let me know what you think!
