Recently, I took a look back at my old projects on Github and decided to do a re-vamp of my old journal app.

Built on Next w/ a Tailwind UI-kit(Flowbite), I was able to get things up and running rather quickly!

Check it out here - [Journal App](https://erickw-journal-app.vercel.app/)

And check back to see updates! Gonna focus on authentication and the actual journal functionality in the near future!
